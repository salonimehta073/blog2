Can't believe it's going to be a year since my last post. 
I really wanted to keep this up. But I guess complacency and life comes in the way of average blogs? Hah. A lot has happened since my last post.
I started a new job in September last year with the promise of a move to Munich, Germany in six months. 
The company and the team were great and I made quite a few friends within the team remotely. 
I was very much looking forward to moving to Germany and get my first experience of living outside my home.
I moved to Germany in April at the tail end of CoVid in Europe. I'll probably do another post about my life here but I just wanted to leave this little update here as a way to commit myself to this second post and hopefully, many more. 
In the last two days, I ended up working on yet another Glide app - a restaurant finder and reviewer for employees of Maltego (the name of the company I currently work at).
I'd like to write about this one too, along with all the other things I've been upto in my new job.

See you soon!
